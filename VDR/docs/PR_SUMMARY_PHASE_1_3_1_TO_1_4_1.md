# Phase 1.3/1.4 Addenda Summary

This patch series introduces the GeoTIFF conversion tool, a cached chart
registry with new FastAPI endpoints, a placeholder GeoTIFF tile service and a
MapLibre AppMap capable of switching between OSM, GeoTIFF and ENC bases.  It also
documents CM93/Sâ€‘57 readiness and provides operator notes for importing charts
and refreshing the registry.
