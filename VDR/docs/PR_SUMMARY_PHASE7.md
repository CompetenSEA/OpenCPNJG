## Summary
- auto-generation covers every S-52 lookup with `metadata.maplibre:s52`
- coverage tooling reports presence and portrayal metrics; docs reflect them
- CI stages local assets, validates styles and fails on coverage regressions

## Testing
- `pytest -q VDR/server-styling/tests/test_full_s52_coverage.py`

## Risks & Mitigations
- auto-generated styles are minimal; future phases will refine portrayal
